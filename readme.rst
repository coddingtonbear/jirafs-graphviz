Quickstart
----------

You can enter a digraph into your document by using the ``graphviz`` macro::

   <jirafs:graphviz>
      digraph {
         a -> b;
      }
   </jirafs:graphviz>

or::

    <jirafs:graphviz src="name-of-digraph-file.dot" />

Options
-------

You can control the type and characteristics of the graph generated by specifying
any of the following attributes:

* `src`: Use the referenced file for your graph's contents.  Note that this
  cannot be specified if graph contents are specified directly in your
  tag's contents.
* `command`: (Default: `dot`) Which graphviz command to execute.  Common
  options include 'dot' and 'neato', but may vary depending upon your
  graphviz installation.
* `format`: (Default: `png`) File format to generate.
